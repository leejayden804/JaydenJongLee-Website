          <h3>4 Years</h3>
          <p>I've been as passionate about game development as ever these last few years, especially when quarantine started. Take a look at my Unity projects down below to see my works! (Candybird 2D,  Gym Jammin', and Fizzy Frenzy)</p>

          <p>I've educated kids ages 6-12+ coding through the art of creating video games: managing classroom settings, adapting lessons to learning styles, training new employees, touring prospective students, and leading the dojo are all apart of the job!</p>

        <h1>Candybird 2D</h1>
        <h3>Candybird 2D was my first Unity game published on itch.io in 2022! In this hyper-casual game, you play as a bird traveling far to collect candies and avoid airplanes. Use the candies you collect in this game to purchase new skins for the bird. </h3>

      <h1>Haunted Home Designer 2D</h1>
      <h3>Haunted Home Designer 2D was my first GameMaker game I created at NYU Tisch in 2023! After moving into an old, abandoned house, Avery quickly realizes that her new home is haunted by friendly ghosts! Join Avery and the friendly ghosts in an effort to restore the house to what it once was many decades before.</h3>

    <h1>Gym Jammin'</h1>
    <h3>Gym Jammin' is my most recent project in 2024, where I took my love for going to the gym and turned it into a rhythm game. It's still in-progress, and I am not nearly done with it. Gym Jammin' is a casual rhythm game for players who love games like Rhythm Heaven or FNF and love going to the gym! How high can your score go? Can you get all the trophies? </h3>

  <h1>Fizzy Frenzy</h1>
  <h3>Fizzy Frenzy is a fun little 2D platformer I made with my friends in the Game Development Club. You play as a ticking time bomb who has to race through the sky, avoiding tons of obstacles like spikes and zombies before time runs out. Along the way, there are clocks that will increase your time. Make it to the end or BOOOOM! </h3>
